## Project Idea
# Clean Solutions - Web Booking System
This project creates a web application for Clean Solutions, a cleaning service based in South Wales, UK. It offers users a platform for booking both one-off cleans and subscribing to regular cleaning services.

## Possibilities
Convenience: Users can easily book cleaning services online, 24/7.  
Flexibility: Supports both one-off and subscription-based bookings.  
Security: Secure user authentication and data storage.  
Streamlined Workflow: Simplifies booking management for Clean Solutions.  
### Target Users  
Private Users: Individuals seeking cleaning services for their homes.  
Business Users: Businesses requiring cleaning services for their offices.  
Government Organizations: Schools, police forces, and other government entities needing clean-up services.

Documentation: Create a comprehensive README.md file explaining the project and user functionalities.  
Version Control: Use Github for version control.  
Attribution: Clearly separate your code from external libraries/tutorials, crediting sources where applicable.  
Deployment: Deploy the final application to Heroku.
